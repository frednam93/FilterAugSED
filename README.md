Paper is available in [DCASE Technical report](http://dcase.community/documents/challenge2021/technical_reports/DCASE2021_Nam_41_t4.pdf) and arxiv(will be submitted soon).<br>

## Requirements

## Dataset
You can download dataset by reffering to [DCASE 2021 Task 4 description page](http://dcase.community/challenge2021/task-sound-event-detection-and-separation-in-domestic-environments) or [DCASE 2021 Task 4 baseline](https://github.com/DCASE-REPO/DESED_task). Then, set the dataset directories in config.yaml accordingly. You will need DESED real datasets(weak/unlabeled in domain/validation/public eval) and DESED synthetic dataset(train/validation).

## Training
If you run main.py, it will train and save model in exps folder.
- 'python main.py'

## Evaluation

## Reference
[DCASE 2021 Task 4 baseline](https://github.com/DCASE-REPO/DESED_task)
